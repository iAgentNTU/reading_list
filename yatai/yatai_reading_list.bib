	Abstract = {Robust intelligent systems require commonsense knowledge. While significant progress has been made in building large commonsense knowledge bases, they are intrinsically incomplete. It is difficult to combine multiple knowledge bases due to their different choices of representations and reasoning techniques, thereby limiting users to one knowledge base and its reasoning methods for any specific task. Instead of merging knowledge bases into a single one, this paper presents a multiagent system for commonsense knowledge integration, and proposes approaches to (1) matching knowledge bases without a common ontology for reasoning, (2) combining different reasoning methods to answer queries from application, and (3) improving coverage of knowledge base via resource-bounded crowdsourcing. Two case studies on video editing and dialog assistance interfaces are also presented to show their improvement in handling user's actions after incorporating the proposed reasoning system.},

	Abstract = {We present YAGO, a light-weight and extensible ontology with high coverage and quality. YAGO builds on entities and relations and currently contains more than 1 million entities and 5 million facts. This includes the Is-A hierarchy as well as non-taxonomic relations between entities (such as hasWonPrize). The facts have been automatically ex- tracted from Wikipedia and unified with WordNet, using a carefully designed combination of rule-based and heuris- tic methods described in this paper. The resulting knowl- edge base is a major step beyond WordNet: in quality by adding knowledge about individuals like persons, organiza- tions, products, etc. with their semantic relationships - and in quantity by increasing the number of facts by more than an order of magnitude. Our empirical evaluation of fact cor- rectness shows an accuracy of about 95%. YAGO is based on a logically clean model, which is decidable, extensible, and compatible with RDFS. Finally, we show how YAGO can be further extended by state-of-the-art information extraction techniques.},

@article{chen2009ontology,
	Abstract = {Purpose - This paper aims to serve two main purposes. In the first instance it aims to it provide an overview addressing the state-of-the-art in the area of activity recognition, in particular, in the area of object-based activity recognition. This will provide the necessary material to inform relevant research communities of the latest developments in this area in addition to providing a reference for researchers and system developers who ware working towards the design and development of activity-based context aware applications. In the second instance this paper introduces a novel approach to activity recognition based on the use of ontological modeling, representation and reasoning, aiming to consolidate and improve existing approaches in terms of scalability, applicability and easy-of-use. 

Design/methodology/approach - The paper initially reviews the existing approaches and algorithms which have been used for activity recognition in a number of related areas. Form each of these their strengths and weaknesses are discussed with particular emphasis being placed on the application domain of sensor enabled intelligent pervasive environments. Based on an analysis of existing solutions, the paper then proposes an integrated ontology-based approach to activity recognition. The proposed approach adopts ontologies for modeling sensors, objects and activities, and exploits logical semantic reasoning for the purposes of activity recognition. This enables incremental progressive activity recognition at both coarse-grained and fine-grained levels. The approach has been considered within the realms of a real world activity recognition scenario in the context of assisted living within Smart Home environments. 

Findings - Existing activity recognition methods are mainly based on probabilistic reasoning, which inherently suffer from a number of limitations such as ad-hoc static models, data scarcity and scalability. Analysis of the state-of-the-art has helped to identify a major gap between existing approaches and the need for novel recognition approaches posed by the emerging multimodal sensor technologies and context-aware personalised activity-based applications in intelligent pervasive environments. The proposed ontology based approach to activity recognition is believed to be the first of its kind which provides an integrated framework based on the unified conceptual backbone, i.e., activity ontologies, addressing the lifecycle of activity recognition. The approach allows easy incorporation of domain knowledge and machine understandability which facilitates interoperability, reusability and intelligent processing at a higher level of automation. 

Research limitations/implications - There are a number of challenges which have not been addressed within this paper. These mainly relate to the explicit modelling of the temporal dimension of the problem and managing uncertainty in both the sensor and decision making process. These will be key areas for consideration within our future work. 

Practical implications - We have used existing tools and APIs to illustrate the concepts of our activity recognition approach. Further work is required to support large-scale implementation and evaluation of the concepts in order for the approach to be deployed in real-world applications. 

Originality/value - The comprehensive overview and critiques on existing work on activity recognition provides a valuable reference for researchers and system developers in related research communities. The proposed ontology-based approach to activity recognition, in particular the recognition algorithm has been built upon description logic based semantic reasoning and offers a promising alternative to traditional probabilistic methods. In addition, Activities of Daily Living (ADL) activity ontologies in the context of smart homes have not been, to the best of our knowledge, been produced elsewhere.

@article{gruber1993translation,
	Abstract = {To support the sharing and reuse of formally represented knowledge among AI systems, it is useful to define the common vocabulary in which shared knowledge is represented. A specification of a representational vocabulary for a shared domain of discourse - definitions of classes, relations, functions, and other objects - is called an ontology. This paper describes a mechanism for defining ontologies that are portable over representation systems. Definitions written in a standard format for predicate calculus are translated by a system called Ontolingua into specialized representations, including frame-based systems as well as relational languages. This allows researchers to share and reuse ontologies, while retaining the computational benefits of specialized implementations. We discuss how the translation approach to portability addresses several technical problems. One problem is how to accommodate the stylistic and organizational differences among representations while preserving declarative content. Another is how to translate from a very expressive language into restricted languages, remaining system-independent while preserving the computational efficiency of implemented systems. We describe how these problems are addressed by basing Ontolingua itself on an ontology of domain-independent, representational idioms.},

@inproceedings{suchanek2013knowledge,
	Abstract = {The proliferation of knowledge-sharing communities such as Wikipedia and the progress in scalable information extraction from Web and text sources have enabled the automatic construction of very large knowledge bases. Endeavors of this kind include projects such as DBpedia, Freebase, KnowItAll, ReadTheWeb, and YAGO. These projects provide automatically constructed knowledge bases of facts about named entities, their semantic classes, and their mutual relationships. They contain millions of entities and hundreds of millions of facts about them. Such world knowledge in turn enables cognitive applications and knowledge-centric services like disambiguating natural-language text, semantic search for entities and relations in Web and enterprise data, and entity-oriented analytics over unstructured contents. Prominent examples of how knowledge bases can be harnessed include the Google Knowledge Graph and the IBM Watson question answering system. This tutorial presents state-of-the-art methods, recent advances, research opportunities, and open challenges along this avenue of knowledge harvesting and its applications. Particular emphasis will be on the twofold role of knowledge bases for big-data analytics: using scalable distributed algorithms for harvesting knowledge from Web and text sources, and leveraging entity-centric knowledge for deeper interpretation of and better intelligence with Big Data.},
